This repository contains the code for "Getting and Cleaning the Data" course project where it reads the Human Activity recognition dataset and produces a tidy set.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files:
  1.  run_analysis.R: loads the meesy data and tidies it up by transformations:
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
  2. codeBook.md: a code book that describes the data, the variables and the transformations to produce the tidy set
  3. TidyResult.txt: tidy data produced by the transformations by the run_analysisR code
